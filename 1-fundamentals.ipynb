When you create a variable, you specify a name for the variable and a value to store in the variable. You can then use the variable name in your program to refer to the value stored in the variable.\n",

    "### Data Types & Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Types\n",
    "For short, a data type describes a set of possible values and operations that can be performed on a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a data type is a category for values. Every value in Python has a data type, which determines the kind of operations that can be performed on that value and the way the value can be stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several built-in data types in Python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numbers: Python has three types of numbers: integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), and complex numbers (complex). Integers are whole numbers, while floating-point numbers have decimal points. Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strings: A string is a sequence of characters, represented by either single quotes (') or double quotes (\"). Strings can contain letters, numbers, and special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists: A list is an ordered collection of values that can be of any data type. Lists are written as a series of values separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples: A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable, meaning that its values cannot be modified once it is created. Tuples are written as a series of values separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sets: A set is an unordered collection of unique values. Sets are written as a series of values separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. The keys must be unique and are used to retrieve the corresponding values. Dictionaries are written as a series of key-value pairs separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these built-in data types, you can also define your own data types in Python using classes (more of this in an advanced topic)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "- In computer science, a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Python has a number of built-in data structures, which can be used to store and organize data in an efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python's basic data structures include list, set, tuples, and dictionary. Each data structure is distinct in its own way. Data structures are \"containers\" that organize and categorize data. The mutability and order of the data structures differs from one data structure to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some of the most common data structures in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists: Lists are ordered collections of objects. They can store elements of different data types, and are implemented as arrays in Python. Lists are mutable, which means you can change their contents after they have been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples: Tuples are also ordered collections of objects, but they are immutable, which means you cannot change their contents after they have been created. Tuples are often used to store data that should not be modified, such as records in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dictionaries: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are implemented using hash tables in Python, and are very efficient for looking up values based on their keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sets: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for storing data that does not need to be in a particular order, and for removing duplicates from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strings: Strings are sequences of characters. They are immutable, which means you cannot change the contents of a string after it has been created. Strings are often used to store and manipulate text data."
