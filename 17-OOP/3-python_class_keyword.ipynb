    "The previous objects were all built-in objects of the Python programming language. The user defined objects are created using the class keyword. The class is a blueprint that defines a nature of a future object. From classes we construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. For example, Huck might be an instance of a Dog class.\n",

    "Inside a class, we can define attributes and methods. An attribute is a characteristic of an object. This can be for example a salary of an employee. A method defines operations that we can perform with our objects. A method might define a cancellation of an account. Technically, attributes are variables and methods are functions defined inside a class."
