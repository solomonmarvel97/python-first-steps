    "### Python special methods (dunder methods)\n",
    "In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods that you can use to enrich your classes. They are also known as \"magic methods\" because they begin and end with double underscores (e.g. __init__).\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods allow you to define the behavior of certain operations (such as addition, comparison, etc.) that are applied to your objects. For example, you can use the __len__ method to define the behavior of the len() function when it is called on an instance of your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of some common special methods in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "__init__\n",
    "This method is called when an object is created, and is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "__str__\n",
    "This method is called when an object is converted to a string (e.g. using the str() function). It should return a string representation of the object.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "__repr__\n",
    "This method is similar to __str__, but it is intended to be a more complete representation of the object, suitable for use in debugging and logging.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "__len__\n",
    "This method is called when the len() function is applied to an object. It should return the length of the object.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "__getitem__\n",
    "This method is called when an object is indexed (e.g. using the [] operator). It should return the value at the given index.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "__setitem__\n",
    "This method is called when an object is assigned to an indexed position (e.g. using the [] operator). It should set the value at the given index.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "__delitem__\n",
    "This method is called when an object's item is deleted (e.g. using the del statement). It should delete the item at the given index.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "__add__\n",
    "This method is called when the + operator is applied to two objects of the same type. It should return a new object that is the result of the addition.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "__sub__\n",
    "This method is called when the - operator is applied to two objects of the same type. It should return a new object that is the result of the subtraction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "__mul__\n",
    "This method is called when the * operator is applied to two objects of the same type. It should return a new object that is the result of the multiplication.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "__div__\n",
    "This method is called when the / operator is applied to two objects of the same type. It should return a new object that is the result of the division.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other special methods in Python, and you can find a complete list in the documentation.\n",
