    "# Setting up virtual environments using pipenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipenv is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. It automatically manages project packages through the Pipfile file as you install or uninstall packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipenv is a tool that aims to simplify the process of managing package dependencies in a Python project. It does this by introducing a new file called the Pipfile, which contains all the package dependencies for your project. You can use the pipenv command to install packages, and it will automatically update the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock with the new package information. The Pipfile.lock file is used to ensure that the exact same packages are installed on every machine that runs pipenv install, which can be useful for reproducing environments and avoiding dependency conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipenv is designed to be easy to use, and it integrates with other tools such as pyenv to manage multiple Python versions and pipx to install and run Python packages in isolated environments."
