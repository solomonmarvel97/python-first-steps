    "### Python methods\n",
    "Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to perform operations with the attributes of our objects. Methods are essential in the encapsulation concept of the OOP paradigm. For example, we might have a connect method in our AccessDatabase class. We need not to be informed how exactly the method connect connects to the database. We only know that it is used to connect to a database. This is essential in dividing responsibilities in programming, especially in large applications.\n",
